# Dotfiles Setup

This repository contains the dotfiles for my system.

## Requirements

### Homebrew
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

		First, clone this repository into your home directory:

		```bash
		git clone https://github.com/lukebennett88/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
		```

2. **Install Homebrew and packages**

		Navigate to the `.dotfiles` directory and install the packages from the `Brewfile`:

		```bash
		cd ~/.dotfiles
		brew bundle install
		```

3. **Symlink the dotfiles**

		Use GNU Stow to create symlinks for the dotfiles. This will place the files in the correct locations:

		```

4. **Reload the shell**

		After installation, start a new terminal session or reload the shell:

		```bash
		exec zsh
		```
